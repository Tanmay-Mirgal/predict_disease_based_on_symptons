# 🏥 Predict Disease Based on Symptoms

**Predict Disease Based on Symptoms** is a web application that allows users to input symptoms and get predictions for potential diseases using a trained machine learning model. The backend is built with Flask, which loads and serves the trained model, while the frontend is developed in React.js for a seamless user experience.
